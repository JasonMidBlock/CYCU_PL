# CYCU_PL
Our-C interpreter
This is a simple C language interpreter written in C++. It supports basic C syntax, expressions, variables, control flow, and simple execution. The goal of this project is to understand how a programming language is parsed and executed.


## Project Goals

- Build a basic interpreter for a simplified version of C
- Practice writing a lexer, parser, and abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Learn how variable scopes, memory, and execution work

---


## Features

- Integer variable declaration and assignment (e.g., `int a = 10;`)
- Arithmetic expressions with operator precedence
- `if`, `else` conditional statements
- `while` and `for` loops
- Local and global variable scope
- (Optional) Simple function support

---

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Handwritten lexer and parser (recursive descent)
- Custom AST and symbol table
